# UnityDemo01
This is my first project in Unity  

Completed: basic character movement, simple AI for enemies, map pass conditions.  

Will complete: sound effects added, UI information added (such as life value, time, prop icons), some special props, sprint function, particle effects.  

Known Bugs:   
i. There is an issue with the character's ground detection, which can cause incorrectly loaded walking animations.   
ii. Clicking restart when ending the game will jump to the death screen.
